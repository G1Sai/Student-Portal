STUDENT PORTAL

INTRODUCTION

A student portal that enables its user to login, view registered courses, register to new courses, check grades, check notifications, and get college information.

The portal recognizes two roles: Admin, and Student.

ADMIN

Admin can add new courses to the existing list.

Admin can approve or reject new Student applications. Upon approval, Unapproved Student role is changed to Approved role and they can make use of the portal features.
Rejected applications are deleted automatically.

Admin can add notifications that will reach all the approved students.

Admin can update college information viz., contacts of the relevant faculty members.

STUDENT

Any student can create an account in the portal by entering full name, ID number, and email. However, until the admin has approved the account, the features are not unlocked.

Only approved students can register to courses, check notifications, and access college information.
